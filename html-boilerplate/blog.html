        <h3>HAIL HOLY QUEEN</h3>
        
        <p>Hail, holy Queen, <strong>mother of mercy</strong>,
our life, our sweetness, and our hope.
To thee do we cry, <em>poor banished children of Eve</em>;
to thee do we send up our sighs,
mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.
Turn, then, most gracious advocate,
thine eyes of mercy toward us;
and after this, our exile,
show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.

Pray for us, O holy Mother of God.
That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.</p>
